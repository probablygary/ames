disclaimer:

the reason for my writing this is that I've hit a road block in my career. despite my qualifications, my lack of experience has made me realise just utterly ill-prepared i am to contribute meaningfully to the field of data science. this is me starting from zero, going through every aspect of a project in a methodical fashion in order to explore and understand its meaning and use. i'm just throwing things at the wall to see how it sticks; treating it like a final year research.

i've learnt many things at SAS Institute and I'm putting it to practice.



Actual notes:

Features with relatively high percentage of missng values will be discarded first (KIV in case they can be used as rare valuse)
    - PoolQC, MiscFeature, Alley, Fence, FireplaceQu, LotFrontage


Convert categorical variables to numerical so they can be compared
    - LabelEncoder for ordinal
    - One-hot for vanilla categorical
